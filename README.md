# Achievement Generator

## Description
A web application that allows the user to upload an image or select an icon, add custom header/body text, and generate/download an achievement from it. Currently their are four brands in the app, each with their own achievement (Xbox and PS are built to mimic their actual achievements) while Minnmax and Nintendo are just hypothetical.

To test out the web app, be sure to check out the [Demo](https://achievement-creator.web.app).
